# FoodOpp-App

FoodOpp App is a web application that focuses on food business opportunities. The goal of the app is to provide a platform where users can suggest potential locations for food trucks, carts, and other mobile food businesses. It enables people to enter an address or point at a location on a map to suggest a place they believe would be great for an ice-cream truck, falafel truck, or any food cart. Food vendors can use this platform to find and seize opportunities for a good spot for their ad-hoc business by listening to crowd suggestions.

The FoodOpp App is built using the following technologies:

Front-end:
* JavaScript
